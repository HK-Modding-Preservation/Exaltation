# Exaltation

This mod for Hollow Knight implements the scrapped mechanic of "charm glorification" in the Godmaster content pack. In short, it allows you to empower your charms by progressing through the various boss rush rooms (Pantheons) in the Godhome area.

Created by Xhuis with a lot of help from modders in the Hollow Knight Discord, including 56, 753, Avenging Angle, and others. You guys rock.

## Features

* Complete each Pantheon to gain the power of its god, and rest at a bench to glorify their charms.
* Each Pantheon "glorifies" a set of your charms, making them more powerful.
* Most, but not all, charms have glorified variants.
* *Glorification is currently one-way.* This might change in the future.
